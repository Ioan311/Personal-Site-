# Personal-Site-

I just started with a simple HTML page, then I generated pages using Java Script.
For menu styling I used CSS, also CSS helps me to manipulate other objects from layout by using transitions and animations. One interesting thing for the menu is
about screen resolutions, my website was made for 3 screen types (a mobile one, a medium one, a large one) and for each of these resolutions the menu display changes
and some animatons are disabled.

I generated special error pages for different types of errors by using Java Script (403 and 404 - custom title)
I added a VTT file for a video, because I wanted to have subtitles..
